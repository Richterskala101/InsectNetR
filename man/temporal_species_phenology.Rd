\title{Temporal Phenology and Stridulation Activity of Orthopteran Species}
\format{
A tibble with 28 rows and 8 variables:
\describe{
\item{genus}{Genus of the species (character).}
\item{species}{Species name (character).}
\item{season_start}{Start of seasonal activity (month number, numeric).}
\item{season_end}{End of seasonal activity (month number, numeric).}
\item{peak_activity_start}{Start of peak daily stridulation activity (hour of day, numeric).}
\item{peak_activity_end}{End of peak daily stridulation activity (hour of day, numeric).}
\item{intermediate_activity_start}{Start of intermediate daily activity (hour of day, numeric).}
\item{intermediate_activity_end}{End of intermediate daily activity (hour of day, numeric).}
}
}
\usage{
temporal_species_phenology
}
\description{
A dataset summarizing seasonal and daily activity patterns of 28 Orthopteran species (grasshoppers and bush-crickets) based on literature (e.g. Ragge & Reynolds 1998; Roesti & Keist 2009)
It includes both coarse seasonal activity (months) and fine-scale diurnal activity windows (by hour), split into peak and intermediate activity periods.
}
\details{
Daily activity time blocks were originally categorized into 7 periods and converted to continuous hour ranges assuming a fixed sunrise at 6:00 and sunset at 21:00.
Values in \verb{peak_activity_*} correspond to periods with highest stridulation intensity, while \verb{intermediate_activity_*} includes times of moderate activity.
