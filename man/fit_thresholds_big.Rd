\title{Fit one large conditional inference tree per species}
\usage{
fit_thresholds_big(atf, maxdepth = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{atf}{data.table or data.frame containing aggregated time-series
features. Must include columns: \code{german}, \code{validation} (0/1),
and all ATF predictors (as produced by \code{calculate_atf}).}

\item{maxdepth}{integer, maximum depth of the tree (default 5).}
}
\value{
a named list of \code{partykit::ctree} models, one per species.
}
\description{
This function fits a single conditional inference tree for each species,
using all available ATF predictors simultaneously. Compared to the
Singer-style shallow approach, this produces more complex trees but
greatly reduces code and model-selection overhead.
