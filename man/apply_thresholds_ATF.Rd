\title{Apply species-specific threshold models to ATF detections}
\usage{
apply_thresholds_ATF(atf, thresholds, type = c("shallow", "big"))
}
\arguments{
\item{atf}{data.table or data.frame containing aggregated time-series
features, including columns \code{detID}, \code{german}, \code{conf}, etc.
as produced by \code{calculate_atf()}.}

\item{thresholds}{Either:
\itemize{
\item a \code{data.table} of threshold rules from \code{fit_thresholds_shallow()},
\item or a named list of \code{partykit::ctree} objects from \code{fit_thresholds_big()}.
}}

\item{type}{character, one of \code{"shallow"} or \code{"big"}, indicating
the format of \code{thresholds}.}
}
\value{
data.table of detections with an additional column \code{keep}
indicating whether the detection passed the thresholding.
}
\description{
This function filters detections based on species-specific threshold rules,
either from the shallow Singer-style models (\code{fit_thresholds_shallow})
or from big-tree models (\code{fit_thresholds_big}).
}
