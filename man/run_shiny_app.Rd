\title{Run the Segment Reviewer Shiny App}
\usage{
run_shiny_app()
}
\value{
Launches the Shiny application in the user’s default browser.
}
\description{
This Shiny application provides an interactive interface for manually
validating predicted audio segments from a classification model.
}
\details{
Users can:
\itemize{
\item Select a directory containing audio segment files (WAV format).
\item Specify a save location and filename for validation results.
\item Manually review each segment and annotate it as \emph{Correct},
\emph{Incorrect}, or \emph{Skip}.
\item Inspect spectrograms with zooming functionality.
\item Listen to audio clips directly in the browser.
\item View a logistic regression calibration plot to assess model score
probabilities.
\item Download plots and export validated results to CSV.
\item Automatically compute score thresholds for target probabilities
(0.7, 0.8, 0.9).
}

This tool is useful for calibrating and validating machine learning models
for audio classification tasks.

The app expects a folder structure where subdirectories represent classes
(e.g., \code{Bird}, \code{Frog}, etc.), each containing \code{.wav} audio segments.
The last underscore-separated part of each filename should encode the
model score, which is used in calibration.
